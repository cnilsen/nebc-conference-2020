### Climate Change and Stormwater

#### Details:
How will climate change impact the Pacific Northwest? For stormwater impacts, heavy rainfall events are projected to become more intense over time. With help from the UW Climate Impacts Group, local jurisdictions and stormwater professionals are assessing the impact of urban and rural runoff, stream response and BMP performance under different climate scenarios and the projected increase in heavy precipitation.
